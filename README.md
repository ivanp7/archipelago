# Archipelago

A versatile, modular application configured via memory-mapped files and plugins that define its specific behavior.

## Usage Overview

The `archi` executable accepts one or more memory-mapped initialization files containing instructions and supplementary data.
It processes these input files sequentially to reach the desired state and perform specified actions.

## Contexts

The basic unit of operation is a **context**: any object or resource conforming to a generic interface supporting:

- `init()`: Allocate/initialize context using provided parameters.
- `final()`: Finalize/destroy the context.
- `get()`: Retrieve a pointer from the context by slot (name + list of integer indices).
- `set()`: Assign a pointer within the context by slot (name + indices).
- `act()`: Invoke an action on the context by slot (name + indices).

All contexts are registered in an internal registry -- a hashmap with string keys.

For comprehensive descriptions see [docs/contexts.md](docs/contexts.md).

## Instruction Types

Initialization files may contain different instruction types:

- `NOOP`: No operation.
- `INIT_FROM_CONTEXT`: Initialize new context using the interface of another existing one; insert into registry.
- `INIT_FROM_SLOT`: Get interface from another's slot; initialize new context; insert into registry.
- `INIT_POINTER`: Initialize new pointer context; insert into registry.
- `INIT_DATA_ARRAY`: Initialize new data pointer array context; insert into registry.
- `INIT_FUNC_ARRAY`: Initialize new function pointer array context; insert into registry.
- `COPY`: Create a context alias.
- `FINAL`: Finalize/remove specified context from registry.
- `SET_TO_VALUE`: Set value/data pointer in given slot of specified context.
- `SET_TO_CONTEXT_DATA`: Set context data pointer in given slot of specified context.
- `SET_TO_CONTEXT_SLOT`: Copy pointer across slots between two contexts as instructed.
- `ACT`: Trigger named action on target context.

For comprehensive descriptions see [docs/instructions.md](docs/instructions.md).

## Built-in Contexts

Several built-in contexts exist at startup:
  - `"archi.registry"`: The registry itself (allowing introspection/manipulation).
  - `"archi.executable"`: Library handle of the executable (for access to built-ins).
  - `"archi.input_file"`: Currently processed input file (memory-mapped contents).
  - `"archi.signal"`: Signal management context (access signal flags/install handlers).

For comprehensive descriptions see [docs/builtins.md](docs/builtins.md).

## Built-in Interfaces

These are the exported context interface symbols built into the executable.
They provide foundational mechanisms for configuration, memory management,
processing, data structures, inter-process communication (IPC), resources access, and concurrency.

- **Meta Features**
  - `archi_context_parameters_interface`: Parameter list used for `init()` and `act()` context operations.
  - `archi_context_pointer_interface`: Copied pointer with custom attributes.

- **Memory Management**
  - `archi_context_memory_interface`: Generic memory allocation context.
  - `archi_context_memory_mapping_interface`: Pointer to a mapped region of memory.

- **Hierarchical State Processing (HSP)**
  - `archi_context_hsp_state_interface`: HSP state (function + data + metadata).
  - `archi_context_hsp_transition_interface`: HSP transition (function + data).
  - `archi_context_hsp_interface`: HSP instance (entry state + transition).
  - `archi_context_hsp_frame_interface`: HSP frame (sequence of states).
  - `archi_context_hsp_branch_state_data_interface`: Data for a HSP branch state.

- **Data Structures**
  - `archi_context_ds_hashmap_interface`: Hashmap.
  - `archi_context_ds_lfqueue_interface`: Lock-free queue.

- **Interprocess Communication & Signals**
  - `archi_context_ipc_env_interface`: Value of an environmental variable.
  - `archi_context_ipc_signal_handler_interface`: Signal handler (function + data).

- **OS Resources**
  - `archi_context_res_file_interface`: Open and/or mapped file.
  - `archi_context_res_library_interface`: Loaded dynamic library handle.

- **Thread Groups**
  - `archi_context_res_thread_group_interface`: Thread group context.
  - `archi_context_res_thread_group_work_interface`: Individual task assigned to thread groups.
  - `archi_context_res_thread_group_callback_interface`: Callback invoked upon completion of thread group tasks.
  - `archi_context_res_thread_group_dispatch_data_interface`: Data for a HSP state for thread group work dispatch.

For comprehensive descriptions see [docs/builtins.md](docs/builtins.md).

## External Plugins

There are several external plugins provided in `/plugin` directory:

  - `sdl` (SDL2 windows, PSFv2 font)
  - `opencl` (parallel compute offload using OpenCL)

## Python-based Generation of Initialization Files

Initialization files for `archi` can be generated using the `archi` Python module.
The typical workflow is as follows:

1. Create an instance of the `Registry` class.
2. Manipulate its context registry as if operating directly on live contexts.
3. Create an instance of the `File` class.
4. Assign the context registry to the file, along with additional data, such as set of watched signals.
5. Fossilize the file representation to a byte array.
6. Write the byte array to a file.

To interact with contexts in the registry use dictionary-like access: `app[key]`,
where `app` is the Registry instance and `key` is a string identifier.

- Assigning to `app[key]` initializes a new context and inserts it into the registry.
- Deleting (`del app[key]`) finalizes and removes that context from the registry.

To access slots within contexts:
- Use attribute-style selectors: e.g., `app["foo"].bar`
- Nested fields are supported (`comp1.comp2.comp3`)
- Integer indices may also be used (`comp1.comp2[index1][index2]`)
- Invoke actions on slots using function-call syntax; these accept keyword arguments or an optional parameter list context as positional argumentâ€”e.g.,  `app["foo"].bar(arg1=value1, arg2=value2)`, or `app["foo"].bar(app["baz"], arg1=value1, arg2=value2)`.

To create new contexts:
First declare their interface by instantiating a ``ContextInterface`` object (constructor accepts another context or slot).
This provides its own callable operator accepting similar arguments; instead of executing immediately,
it returns a ``ContextSpec`` which you assign to ``app[key]`` in order to initialize/register that new context.

There is a [script example](plugin/opencl/scripts/program-builder.py) available in the repository.

For comprehensive descriptions see [docs/python.md](docs/python.md).

## binfmt\_misc

Archipelago init files can be made directly executable on Linux systems.

To enable this feature, run `register-binfmt.sh` as root to register the file format with the kernel via `binfmt_misc`.
This allows you to execute `.archi` files without explicitly calling the `archi` binary:

```sh
./file.archi
```

instead of:

```sh
archi ./file.archi
```

Ensure that `archi` is installed in your system path so the kernel can locate it when executing `.archi` files.

# Doxygen ocumentation

Doxygen documentation is available at `/doxygen` subdirectory. To build it, run `make`.

# How to build

0. go to the repository root directory;
1. (optional) export environmental variables to control behavior of `configure.py` (see accepted environmental variables in the script);
2. run `configure.py` to generate `build.ninja`;
3. run `ninja` to build the project.
